# Section 3: Navigating ArcGIS Pro for PET Calculation
ArcGIS Pro provides a powerful set of tools and functionalities for performing spatial analyses, including PET calculations. We'll guide you through the software interface, ensuring you're comfortable and confident using it. Here's a sneak peek of what you'll learn:

1. Adding and exploring data: We'll show you how to import your own data or access publicly available data relevant to PET calculations. You'll learn how to examine the attributes of your data and visualize it on a map.
2. Configuring geoprocessing environments: Geoprocessing environments allow you to control the settings and behaviour of your geoprocessing tools. We'll explain how to set up the appropriate environments for PET calculations to ensure accurate results.
3. Applying geoprocessing tools for PET calculation: This is where the magic happens! We'll walk you through the step-by-step process of using specific geoprocessing tools to calculate PET. We'll explain the parameters and options, ensuring you understand what each tool does and how it contributes to the overall calculation.
Are you ready to embark on this GIS adventure and become a PET calculation pro? Let's dive into Chapter 2, where we'll start by exploring data sources and preparing our project for PET calculation. Get your mapping hat on, and let's continue this exciting journey together!
