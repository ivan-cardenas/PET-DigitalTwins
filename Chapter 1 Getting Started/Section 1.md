# Section 1: Setting Up Your Environment

Before we dive into the exciting world of PET calculation, let's make sure you have everything you need to get started. Here's a quick checklist:

## 1. ArcGIS Pro: 

Ensure that you have ArcGIS Pro installed on your computer. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from the Esri website and follow the installation instructions. Don't worry; they've made the process as smooth as a gentle breeze. Here's a brief guide on how to install ArcGIS Pro:

### Step 1: Check System Requirements

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements for running ArcGIS Pro. These requirements typically include specifications for the operating system, processor, memory (RAM), graphics card, and available disk space. Refer to the Esri website or the ArcGIS Pro documentation for detailed system requirements.
### Step 2: Obtain the Installation Files
To install ArcGIS Pro, you need to obtain the installation files from the Esri website. Follow these steps:
*	Visit the Esri website (https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) and navigate to the ArcGIS Pro product page.
*	Look for the download or trial option, depending on your requirements.
*	Sign in with your Esri account or create a new account if necessary.
*	Follow the prompts to select your license type, agree to the terms and conditions, and initiate the download.

### Step 3: Run the Installer
Once you have the installation files, follow these steps to run the installer:
*	Locate the downloaded installation file on your computer (usually a .exe file for Windows or a .dmg file for macOS).
*	Double-click the installer to launch it. If prompted, grant the necessary permissions to run the installer.
*	In the installation wizard, select the installation location (or use the default location) and choose the components you want to install (e.g., ArcGIS Pro, Python, additional extensions).
*	Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with the installation. The wizard will guide you through the process, including accepting the license agreement and choosing any optional settings.

### Step 4: Activate Your License
After the installation, you need to activate your ArcGIS Pro license. Here's what you should do:
*	Launch ArcGIS Pro from the Start menu (Windows) or Applications folder (macOS).
*	When prompted, select "Authorize ArcGIS Pro using the licensing portal" or a similar option.
*	Sign in with your Esri account credentials.
*	Follow the prompts to authorize your license. You may need to enter a license key or connect to a license server if applicable.

### Step 5: Configure and Update
Once ArcGIS Pro is installed and licensed, it's important to configure and update the software:
*	Configure: During the initial launch, ArcGIS Pro may prompt you to configure various settings, such as the default folder locations, licensing preferences, and display options. Review and customize these settings according to your preferences and needs.
*	Update: To ensure you have the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements, regularly check for software updates. ArcGIS Pro typically offers an automatic update check feature or a manual check within the software. Follow the instructions to install any available updates.
That's it! You should now have ArcGIS Pro successfully installed on your computer. Enjoy exploring the powerful capabilities of this geospatial software and unlocking its potential for your projects.

## 2. Data: 
You'll need relevant spatial data to perform PET calculations. This typically includes information such as temperature, humidity, and land cover. Don't worry if you don't have your own data; we'll show you how to access publicly available data later on.

## 3. Geoprocessing Tools: 
Familiarize yourself with the geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS Pro. These tools allow you to perform various spatial analyses and calculations. We'll introduce and explain each tool as we go along, so no prior knowledge is required. Just keep your curiosity and enthusiasm handy!
