# Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of geoprocessing with ArcGIS Pro! In this guide, we're going to dive into the fascinating realm of calculating the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET). But fear not, even if you're a complete newbie to this concept, we've got you covered!

So, what exactly is PET, you may ask? Well, PET is a clever measure that takes into account both temperature and humidity to estimate how our bodies perceive weather conditions. It's like having a personal comfort-o-meter that tells us how hot or cold it feels, considering not only the actual temperature but also the moisture in the air. In other words, it's the temperature our bodies truly experience, rather than what the thermometer shows.

Now, you might wonder why we need to calculate PET in the first place. Think about it: when planning outdoor activities, urban design, or even assessing the impact of climate change, it's crucial to understand the potential effects on human comfort. With PET, we can analyse and visualize spatial patterns of thermal comfort across different locations, helping us make informed decisions and create better living environments for ourselves.

But don't worry if you're not a weather expert or a GIS guru just yet. We'll walk you through the entire process step by step, making it as easy as a walk in the park on a pleasant day. And the best part? We'll be using the powerful geoprocessing capabilities of ArcGIS Pro, a user-friendly software that allows us to manipulate and analyse geographic data with ease.

So, get ready to embark on this geospatial adventure with us! By the end of this guide, you'll not only know how to calculate PET but also gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence our comfort and how to harness the power of geoprocessing tools to make sense of it all. Let's get started and unlock the secrets of thermal comfort together!
