## Section 2: PET Calculation Workflow

Now, let's outline the step-by-step workflow for calculating PET using ArcGIS Pro. We'll cover the essential tools and explain their roles in the process. Don't worry if it seems overwhelming at first – we'll break it down into manageable steps:

## 1.	Climate Variables: T
he first step is to keep at hand the values of the temperature, humidity, solar radiation, solar angle, wet bulb temperature values that you respectively collected. We'll use the this values directly into the equation later on in our calculation process.

## 2.	Deriving PET Inputs: 
PET calculation requires additional inputs, such as wind speed and solar radiation. We'll explain how to derive these inputs using various geoprocessing tools, such as the Calculate Statistics tool and the Area Solar Radiation tool.
a.	Wind Speed:
b.	Bowen Ratio: NDVI is categorized, water bodies, grass, buildings and trees are later added to the categorized NDVI raster.
c.	DEM:
d.	Sky View Factor:

    In order to do this you will need to know how to work with the Model Builder Tool. It is very helpful as it is a visual programming tool in ArcGIS Pro that allows you to create, customize, and automate geoprocessing workflows. First, let’s get you familiarized with some basic concepts in Model Builder: 

In Model Builder, the items displayed on the canvas have different colours and shapes, which convey specific meanings. Here's an explanation of the colour and shape meanings for each item in Model Builder:

a.	Tool: Tools are represented by rectangular icons on the canvas. They perform geoprocessing operations or analyses. The colour of the tool icon is typically blue.

b.	Variable: Variables are represented by oval icons on the canvas. They store data or values used as inputs or outputs in your model. The colour of the variable icon is typically green.

c.	Input: Inputs are represented by thin, solid lines connecting the outputs of one tool or variable to the inputs of another tool. The input line is usually black.

d.	Output: Outputs are represented by thick, solid lines connecting the outputs of a tool or variable to the inputs of another tool or variable. The output line is usually black.

e.	Model Parameter: Model parameters are inputs or outputs that can be configured when running the model. They are represented by a small flag icon attached to the tool or variable. The colour of the flag icon is typically purple.

f.	Derived Output: Derived outputs are outputs that are generated by a tool but not explicitly connected to other tools. They are represented by dashed lines connecting the output of a tool to the canvas. The dashed line is usually black.

g.	Branch: A branch represents a logical flow in the model where one set of tools or operations is executed based on a conditional statement. It is represented by a diamond-shaped icon. The colour of the branch icon is typically orange.

h.	Model Label: Model labels are used to provide descriptive text or comments on the canvas. They are represented by rectangular boxes with a folded corner. The colour of the model label icon is typically gray.

These colour and shape conventions help visually distinguish between different elements in your model, making it easier to understand the structure and flow of your geoprocessing workflows in Model Builder. By utilizing these visual cues, you can quickly identify tools, variables, inputs, outputs, branches, and labels, facilitating the design and comprehension of your models.


You should also get familiar with actions, including adding variables, tools, defining inputs and outputs, and linking them together:

a.	Opening Model Builder: To start using Model Builder, open ArcGIS Pro and create or open a project. Then, navigate to the "Analysis" tab on the ribbon and click on the "ModelBuilder" button to launch the Model Builder interface.

b.	Adding Variables: Variables represent the data or values that will be used as inputs or outputs in your model. To add a variable, you can either right-click on the canvas or click on the "Add Variable" button in the Model Builder toolbar. Specify the variable's name, data type, and any other necessary properties. Variables can be used to store input data, intermediate results, or output data.

c.	Adding Tools: Tools represent geoprocessing operations that perform specific tasks or analyses. To add a tool to your model, you can either search for it in the "Toolbox" pane and drag it onto the canvas or click on the "Insert" button in the Model Builder toolbar and choose the desired tool from the list. Each tool has its own set of parameters that you can configure based on your requirements.

d.	Defining Inputs: Inputs are the data or variables that you provide to the tools for analysis. To define an input for a tool, you can either drag a variable from the Variables pane onto the tool or right-click on the tool and choose "Model Parameter" to create a new input variable. Inputs can be features, rasters, tables, or any other applicable data type.

e.	Defining Outputs: Outputs are the results generated by the tools in your model. To define an output, you can either right-click on a tool and choose "Model Parameter" or drag an existing variable to the tool. Outputs can be specified as variables, allowing you to use them as inputs for subsequent tools or store them as final results.

f.	Linking Inputs and Outputs: To connect the inputs and outputs between tools, you can click and drag from the output of one tool to the input of another tool. This establishes the flow of data and dependencies within your model. You can also link inputs and outputs to variables by dragging connections to or from the variables on the canvas.

g.	Configuring Tool Parameters: For each tool in your model, you can double-click on it to open its properties dialog. Here, you can configure the tool's parameters, such as specifying input datasets, setting analysis options, defining output locations, and adjusting any other relevant settings.

h.	Running the Model: Once you have built and configured your model, you can run it by clicking on the "Run" button in the Model Builder toolbar. This will execute each tool in the model in the defined order, passing inputs and collecting outputs as specified. You can monitor the progress and view any generated messages or warnings during the execution.

Note: It is also important to know that some variables and features will need to be set as “Parameter” in the Model Builder, this can be done by right clicking it and setting the green check on in the menu that will pop up. Whenever you do this a small P will appear beside your feature or variable letting you know which ones have or have not been set already. Now you know what we mean when we ask you to set a variable or feature as parameter.

In Model Builder, setting features and variables as parameters is like making your geoprocessing model flexible and customizable. Parameters allow you to input different values or datasets when running the model, without having to modify the model itself. It's like having adjustable dials on a control panel. Have you seen when a program asks you to input a name or a file before running a process? This is what you will be able to achieve when you set inputs as parameters. This flexibility makes your model more versatile and adaptable to different scenarios. It's like giving your model a set of knobs and switches so that you can fine-tune its behaviour for specific needs without rebuilding it from scratch.


By utilizing variables, tools, inputs, outputs, and linking them together, Model Builder allows you to create complex geoprocessing workflows in a visual and intuitive manner. This empowers you to automate repetitive tasks, streamline analyses, and improve efficiency in your GIS workflows.
