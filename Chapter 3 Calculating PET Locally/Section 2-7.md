### RUN THE PET MODEL: 

Now that you have everything set properly you can try running the entire model and check if you have done it correctly, don’t worry if you get an error while trying your code, you can always look back on the guide, check each individual step and check if by any chance you didn’t skip a step or you used a different data type than the one specified in the guide. To do so, you can follow these steps:

1. Validate your model: Click on the Validate Model button to check if there are any errors or missing connections in your model. Resolve any validation issues before proceeding.

2. Run the model: Once your model is validated, click on the Run Model button to execute it. This will initiate the geoprocessing tasks specified in your model.

3. Monitor the progress: You can monitor the progress of your model execution in the Geoprocessing pane. It will show the status of each tool as it runs, and you can check for any error messages or warnings.

4. Review the results: Once the model completes, you can review the results in the output locations specified in your model. These could be feature classes, raster datasets, or any other outputs generated by the tools in your model.

That's it! By following these steps, you can build and run a your own PET tool made in the  ModelBuilder from ArcGIS Pro to automate your PET analysis workflow!
