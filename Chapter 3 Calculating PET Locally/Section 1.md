# Section 1: Introduction to Geoprocessing Tools

Geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS Pro are your trusted companions when it comes to performing complex spatial calculations. In this chapter, we'll explore the specific tools required for PET calculation. But before we dive into the fundamentals, let's understand the basics of geoprocessing tools:

1.	Toolboxes: Geoprocessing tools are organized into toolboxes, which are like virtual toolboxes containing a set of related tools. Each toolbox focuses on specific functionality, such as spatial analysis, data conversion, or geocoding. For PET calculation, we'll primarily work with tools in the Spatial Analyst toolbox.

2.	Parameters: Geoprocessing tools require certain inputs called parameters to perform their calculations. These parameters include data layers, settings, and other information necessary for the tool to operate correctly. As we go through the process, we'll explain each parameter and how to provide the required inputs.
