# What You Will Need

Before getting started with the guide, make sure you have the following:

### A computer with access to the internet.

### ArcGIS Pro: 

Ensure that you have ArcGIS Pro installed on your computer. ArcGIS Pro is a professional geographic information system software developed by Esri.

### ArcGIS Pro License: 

You will need a valid license to use ArcGIS Pro. If you don't have a license, you can obtain one through Esri or check if you have access to ArcGIS Pro through your organization or educational institution.  As an ITC member, you have access to an Esri license compatible with ArcGIS Pro with your student/corporative email, so it is as easy as logging in with your email and password. If you encounter any issues during the login or license activation process, it is recommended to consult the documentation or contact the support resources provided by your institution or Esri for further assistance.

### Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) Algorithm: 

Understand the concept and principles behind the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) calculation. Familiarize yourself with the algorithm or method used to calculate PET in ArcGIS Pro. You can check Section 2: Understanding the Science Behind PET.

### Basic GIS Skills: 
Having a basic understanding of GIS concepts and tools will be beneficial for following along with the guide. If you are new to GIS, consider familiarizing yourself with fundamental concepts such as spatial data formats, coordinate systems, and geoprocessing operations.

###	GIS Data: 
To perform the PET calculation, you will need the necessary GIS data layers. These may include a digital elevation model (DEM), land cover data, meteorological data (such as temperature, humidity, wind speed), and any other relevant spatial data required for the analysis. Ensure that you have the required data or access to it. You can see a detailed list and how to obtain each individual data in Chapter 2: Data Sources and Project Preparation for PET Calculation

---
Make sure you have these prerequisites fulfilled before proceeding with the guide. Having the necessary software, licenses, data, and knowledge will ensure a smooth experience while using the geoprocessing tool to calculate the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) in ArcGIS Pro.
